# MSI System Software Manual Testing and Documentation Project

## Project Overview
This project involves **manual testing** and **documentation** for the **MSI System Software**. The objective is to ensure the software meets functional requirements and deliver comprehensive documentation for users, administrators, and developers. The project includes creating test cases, reporting bugs, and providing clear and structured documentation to help users and support teams effectively understand and use the system.

## Key Components

### 1. **Manual Testing**
The software has undergone extensive **manual testing** to verify its functionality and usability. The key testing activities performed include:
- **Functional Testing**: Ensuring the software meets the defined functional requirements.
- **Regression Testing**: Verifying that previously fixed issues do not reoccur after new updates.
- **Exploratory Testing**: Exploring the software for any edge cases or undocumented issues.
- **Usability Testing**: Ensuring the system is easy to use and provides a smooth user experience.

### 2. **Documentation**
